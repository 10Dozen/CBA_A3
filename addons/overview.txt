The CBA functions library comprises a number of categories of functions, from
Arrays to Strings, as well as ensuring that all the BIS Functions/MP modules'
functions are precompiled during the pre-init phase.

As a support for the function libray, CBA also provides a number of preprocessor
macros to aid in development.
